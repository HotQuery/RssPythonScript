This project was very enjoyable for me to engage with, 
and I feel like I learned a lot of applicable skills for both
python and coding in general. Throughout this project I enjoyed 
being able to go with it in the direction I wanted, and while I ended up
changing plans from my original idea of a Minecraft world save file copier script
to a RSS feedparser script, I still had a great time learning how to apply 
this dictionary and call member-functions within it. I now have a much better grasp
on how dictionaries work in general, and also how RSS feeds are used and parsed
for certain elements. If I had more time with this project, and had I not been 
moving this last I week, I would have loved to have gone farther with it,
but I will be taking this code into the future and hopefully expanding on it.
This script takes in two RSS feeds from the Minecraft and Science subreddits 
and looks at how many entries have been posted in each today. Then, the program
outputs which subreddit had more posts today. I have also left some commented
out code I would like to return to for iterating through date published for each 
article, and using that information.

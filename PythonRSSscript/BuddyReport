I checked in with Xavier this Wednesday, he's doing a very cool project to transfer save files from an RPG he's playing, 
the program collects the player data from the save folder and transfers it to a back up. Pretty cool. I didn't really get to check in with Xavier 
much until the end of the project, but we were able to provide some support for eachother on our projects, and it was cool seeing how his 
program worked and how I might implement a similar program in the future. Xavier seems to have made excellent progress on his program.
